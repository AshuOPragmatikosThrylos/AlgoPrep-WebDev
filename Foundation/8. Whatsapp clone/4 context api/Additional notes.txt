How to add icons in React?
many more services are there but some popular ones are

material ui icons react
lucid icons react --> copy jsx button for any icon


instead of h-[80px] use h-20 (good practice)....h-20 is provided by tailwind....in multiples of 4


css socho (border-radius) cheat sheet me search kro for corresponding tailwaind class (rounded-lg)

import Login as LoginIcon from 'lucide-react'  (as we have compoenent with same name so importing as Login would create conflict) Login.jsx

-----------------------
what is context?

our application is a DOM tree structure
so if any node wants any data we pass data from the root all way to that node along that branch though props (prop drilling)
so instead of having to send the data as props to those nodes which don't need that information
and so that we can directly send data to the node which actually requires it

Enter CONTEXT - createContext(), <Wrapper.Provider value={val}>, useContext(Wrapper)

PropDrillingSol.tsx

import {useContext} from "react"

export const ContextWrapper = React.createContext()


jahan se value bhejna h
const value = 10;
<ContextWrapper.Provider value={value}>
    <rootElementJahanSeValueBhejnaH></>
</ContextWrapper.Provider>


jahan receive krna h
const message = useContext(ContextWrapper);
<div>value :{message} </div>

------------------
implementing Light/Dark mode using context
------------------------

improving theme context code

useContext(ContextWrapper) --> koi ur component me use krte h to ContextWrapper and useContext dono import krna pdta h, we don't want that

ThemeContext.jsx
useContext(ContextWrapper) --> goal: iske jagah pr useDarkTheme() aisa kuch kr paye

function useDarkTheme() {
    return useContext(ThemeContext);
}
