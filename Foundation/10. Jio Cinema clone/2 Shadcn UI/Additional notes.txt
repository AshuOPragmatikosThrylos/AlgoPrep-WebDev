Material UI, Chakra UI, Ant Design are librares which give components
All above were inspired by Bootstrap
They are rarely used now after Shadcn


Problem with MaterialUI/Chakra UI/Ant design which Shadcn solved
1) if we want any thing customised it was not easy. That's why everyone's website looked similar
2) had to import lot of unused code/components (In Shadcn dev installs only those components which they need not the whole library)

Shadcn is built on top of tailwind (can change styling therefore shadcn solves cutomomisability problem)

Benefits of using component library like shadcn ui
1) it covers edge cases like whether would work on different devices or not
2) responsive
3) accessible (for specially abled people)



jsconfig.js has --> @ means src folder

while importing all paths are mentioned wrt to src folder so it goes like 
import {Button} from "@/components/ui/button"

Shadcn also gives variant
<Button variant="something"></Button>

with variant can use a provided standard styling
with className (refer tailwind) can change the styling at a granular level if need to customise even after using variant


if don't want to use shadcn --> shadcn is based on radix ui
radix gives only functionality in components not styling


components example
1) button
2) badge
3) accordian
4) carousel
5) card
