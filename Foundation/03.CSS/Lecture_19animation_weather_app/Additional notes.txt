border-radius: 0% (by default)

to convert square to circle

.square {
     height:
     width:

     animation-name: shape-changer;
     animation-duration: 42

}

@keyframes shape-changer {
       50 % {
           border-radius: 50%
       }  

       from {
       }

       to { // same as 100%
       }
}


0% --> beginning of animation
100 % --> when animation is complete, returns back to original state. If do not want to return to original state --> animation-fill-mode: forwards

animation-direction: alternate (wapas jis direction me animation hua tha, whi direction reverse me bhi hota h if we use alternate)
